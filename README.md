# A simulation envionment for modelling elevator operations as a multi-agent RL problem


## TODO:
Each elevator idles for at most 10 second at a time. Although it may choose to idle another 10sec.
When passenger arrives, it should iterrupt the idling process of each elevator. 
 - which means that we need a handler on those idling processes
